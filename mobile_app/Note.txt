**Flutter .env Fix — Quick Note**

**Problem:**
App crashed: `.env` not found (black screen).

**Cause:**
Wrong YAML indentation → `.env` not included as asset.

**Fix:**
In `pubspec.yaml`:

```
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - .env
```

Place `.env` in project root and run:

```
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d linux
```

**Result:**
.env loads, app runs fine ✅
